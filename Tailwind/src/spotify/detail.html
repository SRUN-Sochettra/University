      <p class="mb-4">
        The city of Angkor represented the apogee of Khmer architecture and art, combining

      <p class="mb-4">
        Cambodia has been home to a Buddhist temple complex known as Angkor Wat for centuries. 
        This temple, which encompasses over four hundred acres, is one of the largest religious 
        monuments in the world. Since it was constructed by King Suryavarman II, who had governed 
        the territory from 1113 until 1150, it has been referred to as a “temple city” in this 
        Sovannaphumi land, just like the center of the political hub and state temple. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">General Overview of Angkor Wat</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <span class="text-blue-500">Angkor Wat Siem Reap </span>Cambodia where history and nature coexist. Angkor Wat, 
        the biggest and most divine religious structure, shows the advanced architecture 
        of the Khmer Empire. In the Angkorean era, the ancient Khmer Kingdom dominated 
        most of present Southeast Asia from 802 to 1434 AD. The Angkor Complex is the soul 
        of the Khmer people (approximately 90% of Cambodia’s population). 

        The Angkor complex area consists of 200 monuments, which are spread over an area of 
        401 square kilometers. In addition, Khmer kings built various Cambodian temples between
        the 9th and 13th centuries, when the Khmer civilization was at its height of extraordinary 
        creativity. 

        The Angkor architecture is evidence of the strong Khmer religious beliefs – Hinduism and Buddhism.
        And the most popular temples in the Angkor area, are Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Baphuon, 
        Phimeanakas, Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei, and Pré Roup, East Mebon, Kravan, Preah Khan, Neak Poan, 
        Banteay Srei, Rolous Group, etc.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">What is The Location of Angkor Wat? and Who build this vast sophisticated temple? </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Angkor Wat is situated around eight kilometers north of Siem Reap, a contemporary Cambodian city 
        with a population of over 200,000. The Khmer Empire dominated the area for a while, and this
        structure functioned as their capital during that time. As a result, Cambodians refer to the
        capital city as “Angkor,” whereas the name “Wat” refers to a temple.

        The largest religious monument in the world and one of the most iconic structures of all time,
        Angkor Wat, was built almost 900 years ago. King Suryavarman II, the monarch of the land at the time, 
        was a Hindu region follower. Hence Angkor Wat was originally constructed as a Hindu-styled temple. 
        Nevertheless, this wonderful temple in Cambodia had become a Buddhist place of worship by the end of 
        the 12th century. Archeologists are applying the latest techniques to reveal the mysteries of Angkor: A vast city the size of London. 

        The new monarch, Jayavarman VII, commanded all citizens to shift their situated city of Cambodia 
        to Angkor Thom while moving their state temple to Bayon. The transition of moving to other temples 
        was due to the attack of Khmer’s rival tribe at that time.

        As the power and influence of Angkor Wat grew within the context of the Buddhist faith practiced in 
        the area, the folklore associated with the monument also expanded. According to some Buddhists, 
        Lord Indra built the temple on a single night. On the other hand, scholars now know that Angkor Wat 
        took many decades to construct, starting with the planning process and ending with the completion. 
        In short, the building of the temple was started by <span class="text-blue-600"> Suryavarman II </span>  and completed by <span class="text-blue-600"> Jayavarman VII. </span>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">When Was Angkor Wat Built?  </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Angkor Wat is a Hindu temple complex built to replicate the heavens on earth, meaning “City Temple”. 
        It was initially constructed for <span class="text-blue-600">King Suryavarman II </span>in the early twelfth century, during his reign 
        from 1113 to 1150 with astronomical and cosmic rhythm and Hindu influence dedicated to Vishnu. And, 
        The architects of the ancient Angkorian civilization designed and gathered their creative ideas to 
        build the temple where its position interacted precisely with natural phenomena, using architecture 
        skills, mathematical calculations, and astronomy. For example, the Solar Phenomena of Angkor Wat 
        Equinox. It is the best-preserved temple and is the only one to have remained a significant religious
        center since its foundations; first Hindu, dedicated to Vishnu, and later Buddhist.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Angkor receives 400,000 foreign tourists in Q1 2025</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Angkor Archaeological Park, the most attractive tourism landscape in the Kingdom, has witnessed a significant surge in foreign visitors during the first quarter of 2025.
        The park received some 400,000 foreign tourists between January and March of this year, up 15 percent, from 347,534 in the same period last year, according to a report from the Angkor Enterprise overseeing the Angkor Entrance Pass Sales.
        The surge in the number of foreign tourists at the famed Angkor temple complex signalled a robust recovery for Cambodia’s tourism sector.
        Ministry of Tourism’s Secretary of State and Spokeswoman Hun Dany attributed the surge of foreign tourists to the efforts in promoting tourism and enhancing tourists’ convenience in visiting the country.
        “The increase of foreign tourists is a good result of cooperation among the relevant parties between the government and the private sector in promoting potential tourism,” Dany said.
        President of the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents Chhay Sivlin welcomed the positive figures, highlighting several contributing factors including government’s efforts, air connectivity, and enhanced visitor services.
        “Increasing number of foreign tourists was due to the government and relevant ministries cooperating with the private sector in beefing up efforts in promoting the tourism sector,” Sivlin said.
        Air connectivity, direct flights and implementation of systems such as automatic ticket machines have also contributed to enhancing tourists’ convenience, she added.
        She also pointed to the effectiveness of recent promotional campaigns as contributing factors to the increased visitor numbers.
        Large crowds of both local and foreign tourists rallied in front of Cambodia’s iconic Angkor Wat temple on March 21-23 to see the stunning sunrise during the spring equinox, according to the APSARA National Authority.
        To facilitate tours for international tourists, the government launched the Angkor ticketing system and ticket inspection reform system in January, giving more options to foreign tourists and tour agencies to buy 
        entrance tickets, making it easier for tourists to visit the ancient temples.
        The self-service ticketing machine contributes to enhancing visitor convenience, allowing foreign tourists more convenience to purchase tickets quickly and easily, Sivlin added.
        Situated in northwest Siem Reap province, the 401-square-km Angkor Archaeological Park is home to 91 ancient temples, which were built from the ninth to the 13th centuries.

      <p class="mb-4">
        After the Cham captured Angkor in 1177, King <span class="italic">Jayavarman VII</span> 
        restored the empire, dedicating Angkor Wat to Buddhism. Over the centuries, 
        the temple remained active and was later maintained by Theravada Buddhists.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In the modern era, Angkor Wat became a national symbol of Cambodia and a UNESCO 
        World Heritage site, attracting millions of visitors worldwide.
